Shopping made easy....
We provide with a solution where we allow users to create a shopping list, by adding the available things to their cart.
After the user finish filling in their cart, we provide them with a route, they will have to follow, and the list of items they need to buy from the corresponding shops.
We provide 3 kind of paths for the user the to finish shopping:-
1) Shortest Path : which is the shortest path, the user needs to follow to finish their shopping.
2) Cheapest Path : which is the path, which the user can follow to finish their shopping while spending the least possibble amount of bucks.
3) The Optimal Path : is the one, we consider the best, as it takes into account both the distance the user needs to cover, and the amount of money the user needs to spend.

Vision :
* We need to create a different login for the shopkeepers, which can be used by them to update the prices and items available in their shop.
* We can also update the items for users automatically, wherein we can notify the shopkeeper whenever his shop appears in a route, which some user is about to follow, and then the shopkeeper may confirm if the customer arrived at the shop or not.
